# Weekly Go Problems
These are Go Game Guru's Weekly Go Problems: https://gogameguru.com/get-better-at-go/go-problems/

This problem collection was started by David Ormerod and is now maintained by An Younggil (8 dan pro) and David.

New problems, as well as improvements and amendments to the existing problems, will be worked on here and posted to https://gogameguru.com/ periodically.

There's no particular theme for the problems. The criteria for choosing them is simply that problems should be interesting, helpful and entertaining (ideally all of the above). Problems are loosely categorized as easy, intermediate or hard.

## How to Collaborate
Please feel free to create an issue or send us a pull request if you want to contribute to and/or help to improve this collection.

If you're not yet confident about collaborating, but want to ask questions about existing problems, see *How to Ask Questions*, just below.

## How to Ask Questions
If you're working through the problems and have questions, you're welcome to leave a comment in the weekly problem thread for that week (you can find it here: https://gogameguru.com/get-better-at-go/go-problems/)

Asking your questions at Go Game Guru (rather than on Github) will make it easier for us to discuss the problem with you and post variations in diagram form (rather than typing bA1, wB2, bC3 etc, which is hard to parse).

We will occasionally improve existing problems (e.g. add more variations or explanations), based on common questions from the Go community.

### Finding Problem Threads
Problems are numbered in chronological order. For example, ggg-intermediate-97 means week 97.

You can also search for the problems from a particular week here: https://gogameguru.com/?s=weekly+go+problems+97 (e.g. for week 97).
