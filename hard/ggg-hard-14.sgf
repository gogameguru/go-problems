(;B[fr]LB[ep:A]C[This move also kills White, it's second best to the throw in at 'A' though.

Playing this move as the throw in at 'A' would be better style. That's because Black stands to lose less if White brings this group back to life (e.g. using a ko elsewhere on the board to get two moves in a row later). Also, White has three ko threats here now, but if Black had played A, there would only be two. It's a small difference, but accumulating small advantages can eventually give you a big advantage in Go.]))
