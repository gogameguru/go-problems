Sometimes Black's move at C1 (A) is tesuji - for example, if everything was moved one point to the left. 

In this case though, the atari at B is slightly better, because it lets Black remove the two stones from the board in sente later. There are still cutting points around C and D, so Black would prefer not to leave any forcing moves here. This detail is quite minor, and sometimes decisive.]))
