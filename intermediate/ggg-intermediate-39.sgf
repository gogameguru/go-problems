;B[kq]LB[om:G][lo:B][kp:D][lp:A][lq:C][jr:E][kr:F]C[Black 5 is another tesuji. Letting Black apply pressure like this makes the postition easy for him. White should avoid this sequence.

If White plays A now, Black plays B and C or D are miai next. If White plays C instead, Black plays D and White dies. White E is a famous counter tesuji that allows White to save her bottom group. White aims at E, F then A, but playing for a trade instead with White E, Black G instead is good enough because White will eventually have to come back at F while Black takes the initiative on the right side.
