If white plays A now, black plays B and C or D are miai next. If white plays C instead, black plays D and white dies. White E is a famous counter tesuji that allows white to save her bottom group. White aims at E, F then A, but playing for a trade instead with white E, black G instead is good enough because white will eventually have to come back at F while black takes the initiative on the right side.

You may want to explore the variations yourself on a board.]))
